So long! 

This was highly anticipated project by me. I really wanted to learn how to make simple 2d game and I think i learned it. I used MLX42 library for the graphics,
and learned about game-loops, keyhooks etc. So what did I decide to create the game about? A cow chasing milk bottles. I don't know where that idea came from 
but surely it was funny for people. I found the tilesets from itch.io, edited them a bit with some online photoeditor to be 32x32, and then just put the game together.
Took maybe a week to get the game itself rolling, but handling all possible error cases and invalid map errors took another 2 weeks. Just like typically in this school, we
spend a lot of time on error handling and getting it right, because there's no excuse if an evaluator decides to go into the textures directory and change cow.png into duck.png to see
if my program crashes. But I like it, we want to become excellent programmers who think about what could go wrong so that crashes can be prevented and the user can be 
infromed with appropriate message. 

But yes, good project, a bit of a foretaste for miniRT or cub3d, depending on which i'll decide to do.
