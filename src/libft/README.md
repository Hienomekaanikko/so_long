# 🏛️ Libft: Building a Custom C Library from Scratch

Libft is the first project for the students in Hive Helsinki. The idea is to make our own C library from scratch, which will become handy as we proceed in the studies. The library will expand as I move forward in the studies and come in need of more functionalities.

## 🎯 Why Make ALL of the Functions from Scratch?

I imagine it's just a really good way to get to know these functions and use-cases like our own pockets! When situations occur in the future, I'll (hopefully) know exactly what would solve them faster and safely.

## 🚀 Biggest Challenge

The biggest challenge so far in creating this has been efficiently recycling the functions I've already included in the library.

## ⚠️ Importance of Quality

When this project is done poorly, it will come back to bite you because, as previously stated, this library will be used in the upcoming projects.
